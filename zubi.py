You are so special that I can just see you for your entire life and I won't get bored. I JUST LOVE YOU SO MUCH.",

My very first and last desperate prayer will be to get married to you you're so warm+cute+ handsome+ adorable you're just like the man I imagined or I just manifested. You're my herooooooo.",

I feel like I'm still in the dream and living the dream  all these moments feel like a beautiful poem. I BEEN SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.",
